## Mixed effect model

CellRegMap was used for the purpose of interaction testing. Given around 95 cell lines' transcriptome measured for 3 cell types and 3 time points, the model to perform interaction testing is:

$$
y = G\beta + G\gamma + W\psi + \mu + \epsilon
$$

$$
y = \sum_j{\beta_j \tilde{X}} + \sum_m{\theta_m G_m} + \epsilon
$$


where $y$ is gene expression jointly normalized across 9 conditions, $G$ is genotype, $W$ are covariates, $\mu$ is individual random effect, $\epsilon$ is iid error, and $\beta$ and $\psi$ are corresponding fixed effects. The focus of the model is $\gamma$, the random slope for genotypes.

$$
\gamma \sim MVN(0,\sigma Z)
$$

where $Z$ is the design matrix for the 9 conditions. Elements within the same condition are 1, otherwise 0. $\sigma$ dictates the effect size of $\gamma$. CellRegMap follows StructLMM's idea of using Rao's score test to evaluate the null hypothesis that $\sigma$ is 0. According to CellRegMap, this is the highest power test when many contexts were jointly tested.

## P value calibration.

We permuted the 9 conditions for each individual while preserving the fixed effect of genotypes and conditions. Permutation P values show that the calibration of P values are unstable, it can be inflated or deflated depending on the gene tested.

## Results

We tested the dynamic effects on all the top eQTLs from [mixed effect eQTL mapping](eQTL_glimix.html). And applied Storey's q value for multiple testing correction. There are 805 significant eQTLs. 

By visualizing the eQTL, it seems most significant results are cell type specific eQTLs. Some are dynamic eQTL shared across cell types. We need to construct the context differently to detect cell type specific dynamic eQTL.

### Compared with heuristic approach

The heuristic approach identified dynamic eQTLs with FDR<0.05 in 1/6 hours and nominal p value > 0.1 in 0 hour. Somehow it identifies more eQTLs than any interaction testing I tried. After checking the interaction testing results of heuristic eQTL. The cause is two folds:

#### Testing in 9 conditions reduce power for cell type specific dynamic eQTL

This is one example of GABA specific dynamic eQTL.

```{r,echo=F}
dat <- read.table("data/SLC18A2_rs142285028_9cond.txt")
knitr::kable(dat)
```

Changing the design matrix Z and input datawould help with the testing.

```{r,echo=F}
dat <- data.frame(`Testing approach`=c("time point testing across 9 conditions",
                                       "GABA time point testing across 9 condition",
                                       "Time point testing within GABA samples"),
           Pval=c(0.0027,1.4780449107929132e-09,2.3327454922149987e-15))
dat$Pval <- format(dat$Pval, digits=3)
knitr::kable(dat)
```





#### Heuristic dynamic eQTL may have similar betas but different SE

Some heuristic dynamic eQTLs are not significant in any interaction testing. They usually have similar effect size. But one condition has a smaller standard error, resulting in borderline significant P value and FDR.
