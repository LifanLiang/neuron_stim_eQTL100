## Validation

### Validation with matched control SNPs

Sample 10 sets of matched control SNPs with vSampler.

### Effect size concordance

Take lead eQTL per gene to overlap with GTEx eQTL. GTEx eQTL was filtered by qvalue < 0.05. For the overlapped eQTLs, plot whether they have the same effect size direction.
