## Interaction testing model

Within one cell type, we tested whether the genotype has time point specific effects. Following the formula style in `lm`, the model is:

$$
Y_i \sim T_i + G_i + Covar_i + G_i \cdot T_i
$$

where $Y_i$ is the gene expression of sample $i$, $T_i$ is the time point, $G_i$ is the genotype, $Covar$ is the covariates, and $G_i \cdot T_i$ is the interaction term between genotype and time point.

In practice, matrixeQTL only allows effect vs. control interaction terms. Hence I run two types of interaction testing in the matrixeQTL: (1) 0 hour vs. 1 hour (1v0); (2) 0 hour vs. 6 hour (6v0).

## Results on GABA cell type

Interaction testing identified  20 eGenes in both 6v0 and 1v0.
