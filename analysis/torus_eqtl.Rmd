## Enrichment analysis with genomic features

We used TORUS 1.0.4 to evaluate the enrichment of eQTL in genomic features and ASoCs.

## Enrichment analysis comparing dynamic and static eQTLs

We previously performed interaction testing over the LD-pruned top eQTLs from each time point within cell types ([ref](cellregmap.html)). For 1 hour and 6 hour in each cell type, we divided eQTL summary statistics into genes that contain dynamic eQTLs and genes that don't. Only 1 hour glutamatergic cells have higher enrichment in the dynamic set.
