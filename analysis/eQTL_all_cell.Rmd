## Procedure

1. Sum up read counts across cells within a time point, cell type and cell line

2. Apply TPM normalization for each of the 900 samples

3. Remove sequencing batch 22 (95 cell lines remain) and sum up all samples within the same cell line

4. 14772 genes after QC

5. Apply Inverse Normal Transformation (INT)

6. PCA on Normalized expression

7. eQTL mapping using previous genotypes. Covariates include age, gender, disease condition, cell type proportion, genotype PCs, expression PCs,

8. Use 21 expression PCs with the maximum eGenes discovered
