### Individual random effect in a single context

$$
y = G + X + \sigma
$$

The only difference from fixed effect model is the i.i.d. error term modeled as random effect. Still, Z score are shrinked towards zero in LMM.

### Individual random effect shared across all contexts

$$
y = G * context + X * Context + S(v0 \cdot Z + v1 \cdot \sigma)
$$

This model adds individual random effects shared across all context.

The zscore is no longer correlated. The problem could be that the variance of residual error is also shared across contexts.
